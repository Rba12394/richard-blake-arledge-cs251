	* EvaluationVisitor.Java: Modified the first part of the
	  condition (stack.size() >= 2) to check against having an Integer
	  with the value of 0 at the top of the stack.  Also, modified the
	  code so that other numeric operations (addition, subtraction,
	  multiplication) do not take any action if the stack contains
	  less then two elements.  Thanks to Petros Kaklamanis for
	  reporting this.
  
	* TreeOps.java: Modified line:
  
          if((pos = inputString.indexOf('=')) != inputString.length() - 1)
  
          to be line:
  
          if((pos = inputString.indexOf('=')) != -1)

	  since in this condition we need to check if character '=' is
	  within the string inputString, and not if '=' is the last
	  character in the string.  Thanks to Petros Kaklamanis for
	  reporting this.

	* AndroidPlatform.java: Modified line:
	  if(string =="> ")
  
          to be line:
  
          if(string.equals("> "))

	  to compare the contents of the two string objects and not their
	  references.  Thanks to Petros Kaklamanis for reporting this.

	* Reformatted all the code to be consistent with my latest Java
	  code style.
