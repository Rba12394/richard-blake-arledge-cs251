  <p>
    Before you start with Assignment 1 you'll need to do the following
    things:
  </p>za

  <ul>
    <li>
      Download and install IntelliJ IDEA. 
    </li>

    <li>
      Setup an account on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>.  You should have received an invite via your Vanderbilt e-mail.

  </ul>

  <h4>Overview of the Array Assignment</h4>

  <p>
    The purpose of this assignment is to give you experience using Eclipse
    to develop a simple Java Array class.  An Array is an abstract data
    type (ADT) with operations such as get(), get(), and size(). Your task
    is to implement an array of characters in Java.  This array will be
    different from Java built-in arrays since it can be resized.
  </p>
  <p>
    Graduate students (or students who are taking this course for graduate
    credit) must do the following additional work:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Implement the requirements of the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Iterable.html">Iterable</a> interface.

  </ul>

  <p>
    As much as possible, you should avoid using loops in this assignment.  In our solution, we only needed to use an explicit looping construct once.
  </p>
